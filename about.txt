In Express.js, the .use() method is a way to define middleware 
functions that will be executed during the request-response cycle.
Middleware in Express are functions that have access 
to the request object (req), the response object (res),
 and the next middleware function in the application's
  request-response cycle.


app.use(
  cors({
    origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN,
    credentials: true,
  })
);
When credentials: true is set, it allows the browser to send
 cookies or HTTP authentication information (such as tokens) 
 along with the request to a server on a different origin 
 (i.e., a cross-origin request).


The URL-encoded data sent in the request body would look like this:

name=John+Doe&age=25
The express.urlencoded() middleware helps you parse this data into a JavaScript object so that you can access the values easily.

access tokens are short lived and refresh tokens are long lived,
Access tokens are used to access resources, 
while refresh tokens are used to get new access tokens when the
 old ones expire.


///////////////
here User represents mongoose object that can communicate with db table 
we can call mongoose methods like findOne,update, 
but the methods that we define in our user model are accessible
by the user instance returned by the User.findOne query
  const isValidPass = await user.isPasswordCorrect(password);
  if (!isValidPass) {
    throw new ApiError(400, "Invalid credentials.");
  }
  const { accessToken, refreshToken } = await generateTokens(user._id);

  const loggedInUser = await User.findById(user._id).select(
    "-password -refreshToken"
  );
